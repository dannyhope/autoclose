# Safe to Close - Chrome Extension Requirements

## Overview
Safe to Close is a Chrome extension that helps users manage their browser tabs by maintaining a list of URLs that are "safe to close". This allows users to automatically close tabs that match these patterns, reducing browser clutter.

## Core Requirements

### 1. URL List Management
- Users must be able to add new URLs or URL patterns to the "Safe to Close" list
- Users must be able to view all URLs currently in the list
- Users must be able to delete URLs from the list
- The list must persist between browser sessions
- URLs should support partial matching (e.g., "example.com" matches "https://example.com/page")

### 2. Tab Management
- Users must be able to close all open tabs that match any URL in the "Safe to Close" list
- The tab closing operation must be triggered manually by the user
- The extension must not automatically close tabs without user initiation

### 3. User Interface
- The extension must provide a popup interface accessible from the Chrome toolbar
- The interface must be clean and intuitive

- The interface must be responsive and work well within the popup constraints

### 4. Data Storage
- All URL patterns must be stored using Chrome's Storage API
- Data must sync across devices when the user is signed into Chrome
- Storage operations must be efficient and not impact browser performance

### 5. Security & Privacy
- The extension must request minimal required permissions
- The extension must not collect or transmit any user data
- The extension must only access tab URLs, not tab content
